<div>
   <p>This add-on periodically exports selected trend data to a secondary database that is available
       for use by third-party applications.
   </p>
</div>

<div class="helpTitle">Basic Usage</div>
<div class="helpContent">
   <p>
       In order to begin exporting trend data, you must first specify the database to use and the WebCTRL trend sources which should be exported.
       The database configuration is done on the <a href="#settings_page">Settings Tab</a>.
   </p>
   <div class="helpSubTitle">Maintain Tab</div>
   <div class="helpContent">
       <p>This tab shows all the trend sources that have been exported to the database.  There can be a large number of
       trend sources, so you may need to use the search field to find one.  Click on a row to select it.  You may select
       multiple rows using SHIFT/CTRL click.  When a row is selected, the three action buttons at the top will be enabled.
       </p>
       <ul>
          <li>The <strong>Collect Data Now</strong> button triggers the immediate collection of data for the selected sources
             from the WEBCTRL. If a scheduled collection is taking place, this will interrupt the scheduled collection until
             the manual collection is complete.</li>

           <li>The <strong>Enable/Disable Collection</strong> button enables or disables the periodic collection on any selected
               sources. If the sources selected are all enabled, the button will appear as "Disable Collection" and will
               disable the automatic collection on those sources when pressed. Otherwise the button will appear as
               "Enable Collection" and will enable all the sources selected when pressed.</li>

           <li>The <strong>Remove Source...</strong> button removes the selected sources and all collected data from the database.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Note that if you want to stop collecting data from a source, but leave the existing data in the database, you should use "Disable Collection".
        When you use "Remove Source" it also will remove all the previously collected data.
       </p>
   </div>

   <div class="helpSubTitle">Add Or Remove Tab</div>
   <div class="helpContent">
       <p>This tab allows you to add new sources or remove sources currently set to collect data. Select an item in the
           tree to change collection options for a source.
           Any source displayed in bold in the tree is already selected for collection.  The section in the middle of
           the page allows you to add or remove a source and enable or disable collection.
       </p>

       <p>A table name is automatically generated for newly selected sources, but you may edit it if desired.</p>

       <b>Table names must adhere to the following rules:</b>
       <ul>
       <li>The first character must be a letter</li>
       <li>The entire table name must be less than or equal to 18 characters</li>
       <li>The only characters allowed are letters (A-Z, a-z), numbers (0-9), and an underscore ( '_' )</li>
       </ul>
       <blockquote>
           Examples: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "abcDEF_" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "abc123" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "An_example_"
       </blockquote>

   <div class="helpContent">
       <p><strong>Important note:</strong> If you make any change to this page, you must use the "Save" button at the top to use your changes.</p>
       <p>
           <strong>Database Connection Settings</strong><br/>
           This section allows you to configure and test the database connection settings.  Make sure that you use the
           "Test Connection" button to verify your settings.
       </p>

       <p>
           <strong>Automatic Collection Settings</strong><br/>
           These options allow you to select either:
           <ul>
                <li>A specified period for collection (like every 6 hours)</li>
                <li>Daily collection starting at a specific time of day</li>
           </ul>
        </p>

       <p>
       <strong>Alarm Settings</strong><br/>
           The alarm settings section contains a single field for a path to the Trend Export Alarm equipment.
           The control program for this equipment is provided with this add-on, and its use is optional but recommended.
           If present, this equipment allows this add-on to alert system administrators that something has happened that
           requires attention.  You may determine this path by navigating to the Trend Export Alarm equipment in WebCTRL
           and using the "whereami" manual command.  If the equipment has a global reference name (the default), then this
           path is typically something like "#trend_export_alarms".
       </p>

<div class="helpTitle">Database Structure</div>
<div class="helpContent">
   <p>The database schema is intended to be simple and easy to use in other applications.  This schema is fixed and cannot be
   configured.  There is always a "metadata" table and one table per trend source that is exported from WebCTRL.</p>
   <div class="helpSubTitle">Metadata Table</div>
   <div class="helpContent">
      <p>The metadata table contains one row for every trend source that has been exported to this database.  This table consists
      of the following columns:</p>
      <table>
         <thead>
         <th>Column Name</th>
         <th>Column Type</th>
         <th>Description</th>
         </thead>
         <tbody>
         <tr><td>ID</td><td>integer</td><td>An autogenerated integer used as the primary key for this table.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>ReferencePath</td><td>string</td><td>The full reference name path to the trend source.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>DisplayName</td><td>string</td><td>The display name of the trend source. (See Note 1) </td></tr>
         <tr><td>DisplayPath</td><td>string</td><td>The full display name path to the trend source. (See Note 2)</td></tr>
         <tr><td>TableName</td><td>string</td><td>The name of the table which has the data for this trend source.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>SourceType</td><td>short integer</td><td>1 for analog trends, 2 for digital trends, or 3 for equipment color (only in WebCTRL v5.5 and later).</td></tr>
         <tr><td>isEnabled</td><td>short integer</td><td>0 for disabled; 1 for enabled</td></tr>
         </tbody>
      </table>
       <br/>
       These fields are not critical to the functioning of the application:
       <br/>
       Note 1 - This field truncates after the first 100 characters.
       <br/>
       Note 2 - This field truncates after the first 2000 characters.
   </div>
   <div class="helpSubTitle">Trend Data Tables</div>
   <div class="helpContent">
      <p>Each trend source's data is put into a separate table.  The source type (which can be found in the metadata table) determines the data type of the "TrendData" column.
      For analog trends, the "TrendData" column is a floating point number, for digial trends it is a boolean and for equipment color trends it is a short.  Trend data can
      also be missing, which we call "holes" in the data.  This table therefore has a "TrendType" column which will have a value of 1 when the row represents a trend data sample.
      When a hole in the data is found, two records are written to the table.  The first has a type of 2 and marks the start of the hole, and second has a type of 3 and marks
      the end of the hole.</p>
      <table>
         <thead>
         <th>Column Name</th>
         <th>Column Type</th>
         <th>Description</th>
         </thead>
         <tbody>
         <tr><td>ID</td><td>integer</td><td>An autogenerated integer used as the primary key for this table.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>DateStamp</td><td>date</td><td>The date when this sample (or hole) occurred.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>TrendData</td><td>variable*</td><td>The sample data, or null if a hole</td></tr>
         <tr><td>TrendType</td><td>short</td><td>1 for a data sample, 2 for a hole start, 3 for a hole end</td></tr>
         </tbody>
      </table>
      <br/>
      <em>* floating point for analog trends, boolean for digital trends and short for equipment color trends.  Short values for equipment colors are:
      <ul>
         <li>Mustard color (-1). Status unknown. This is used when the system is in design mode.</li>
         <li>Purple color (0). No communications because of a hardware problem.</li>
         <li>Gray color (1). Unoccupied or Inactive.</li>
