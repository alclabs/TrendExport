    The Trend Export add-on is intended to store trends in a secondary database that is available for use outside of
    WebCTRL. Each trend source has metadata stored in what is aptly named "metadata" and has each trend source's source
    path,
    display name, and its type (Analog, Digital, or
    EquimpentColor - only present in WebCTRLv5.5 and up) as they appear in WebCTRL as well as the table name that is
    being used by this add-on.
</div>

<br/>

<div class="helpTitle">
    Using the Interface
</div>

<div class="helpContent">
    On startup, one of the following tabs will be displayed:
    <li>The 'Settings' tab: The connection settings must be configured to connect to the database where the trend
        sources
        will be stored by this add-on.
    </li>
    <li>The 'Maintain' tab: A table of the trend sources currently being collected.</li>
</div>

<br/>

<div class="helpTitle">
    Maintain Tab
    <br/>
</div>

<div class="helpContent">
    This tab shows what is currently trending and some actions that can be performed on any of the selected row(s).
    <br/>
    <li>The "Collect Data Now" allows the add-on to collect data from the WEBCTRL database as soon as possible, but be
    careful! If a scheduled collection is taking place, this will interrupt the scheduled collection to until
    the manual collection is complete.</li>
    <li>Removing a source: This action removes a source from the currently collected items but provides two options.</li>
    <blockquote>
        1) Clearing all data and dropping the table wher the data was stored or <br/>
        2) Not dropping the table and therefore keeping the data in the database.
    </blockquote>
</div>

<div class="helpTitle">
    Add Or Remove Tab
</div>

<div class="helpContent">
    On this tab you can add new sources or remove sources currently being collected. On the left of the page is the
    system tree.
    This tree is a "thin" tree that only shows zone equipment and their parents (up to the system root).
    Any equipment whose text is bold in the tree is already being collected.
    Selecting an item in the tree causes the page to display the the table name and the option
    to remove the source which provides the same two removal options presented in the Maintain tab's remove button.
    <br/>
    The middle of the page contains the data about the selected node - if any. When adding a source, a table name will
    be automatically generated and present in the text field. The
    name may be changed if it is not sufficient or verbose enough.<br/><br/>

    <b>Table names must adhere to the following rules:</b>
    <li>The first character must be a letter</li>
    <li>The entire table name must be less than or equal to 18 characters</li>
    <li>The only characters allowed are letters (A-Z, a-z), numbers (0-9), and an underscore ( '_' )</li>
    <blockquote>
        Examples:
        <li>"abcDEF_"</li>
        <li>"abc123"</li>
        <li>"An_example_"</li>
    </blockquote>
</div>

<br/>

<div class="helpTitle">
    Settings Page
</div>

<div class="helpContent">

    <li>Connection Settings</li>
    This is where the connection settings may be checked, changed, and tested. It is possible to check the connection
    without saving by changing any connection-related option and
    pressing the "Test Connection" button. A message will appear showing the results.

    <li>Automatic Collection Settings</li>
    Here there are two options: The first option allows collection to happen anywhere from 1 to 320 hours (30 days). It
    is recommended that the value not be set too high or too low because either may cause another collection to start
    before the first is incomplete starving a WebCTRL of resources. The second option is set at a daily collection at a
    specific time every 24 hours.

    <li>Alarm Settings</li>
    This is the path to the Alarm Control Program that allows the add-on to alert system administrators that something
    has happened that requires their attention. It is optional but recommended.
