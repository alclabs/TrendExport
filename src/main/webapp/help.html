<div>
   <p>This add-on exports trend data to a secondary database that is available for use by third-party applications.
   This add-on can be configured to periodically export data from selected trend sources to an external
   database.</p>
</div>

<div class="helpTitle">Using the Interface</div>
<div class="helpContent">
   <p>The user needs to specify the database to which the add-on will exported data and the WebCTRL trend sources which should be exported.
   This interface also has some simple database maintainance features.</p>
   <div class="helpSubTitle">Maintain Tab</div>
   <div class="helpContent">
       <p>This tab shows all exported trend sources that are in the export database.  Because they can be a large number of
       exported trend sources, this data is represented as a table that can be paged through and/or searched.  Rows in the
       table can be selected (by clicking anywhere in the row) and multiple rows can be simultaneously selected.  There are
       two action buttons that affect selected table rows:</p>
       <ul>
          <li>The "Collect Data Now" button allows the add-on to collect the selected sources latest data from the WEBCTRL database as
             soon as possible. If a scheduled collection is taking place, this will interrupt the scheduled collection to until
             the manual collection is complete.</li>
          <li>The "Remove Source..." button removes a source from the currently collected items and provides two options.  You can
             either select to clear all associated data from the database or keep the data but stop periodically exported new trend data.</li>
       </ul>
   </div>

   <div class="helpSubTitle">Add Or Remove Tab</div>
   <div class="helpContent">
       <p>On this tab you can add new sources or remove sources currently being periodically exported. On the left of the page is the
       system tree.  This tree is a "thin" tree that only shows equipment with trend souces. Any equipment whose text is bold in the
       tree is already being periodically exported. Selecting an item in the tree causes the page to display the the table name and the option
       to remove the source which provides the same two removal options presented in the Maintain tab's remove button.</p>
       <br/>
       <p>The middle of the page contains the data about the selected node - if any. When adding a source, a table name will
       be automatically generated and presented in the text field. The name may be changed if desired.</p>
       <br/>

       <b>Table names must adhere to the following rules:</b>
       <ul>
       <li>The first character must be a letter</li>
       <li>The entire table name must be less than or equal to 18 characters</li>
       <li>The only characters allowed are letters (A-Z, a-z), numbers (0-9), and an underscore ( '_' )</li>
       </ul>
       <blockquote>
           Examples: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "abcDEF_" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "abc123" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "An_example_"
       </blockquote>
   </div>

   <div class="helpSubTitle">Settings Page</div>
   <div class="helpContent">
       <p>Database Connection Settings<br/>
       This is where the database connection settings may be checked, changed, and tested. It is possible to check the connection
       without saving by changing any connection-related option and pressing the "Test Connection" button. A message will appear showing the results.</p>

       <p>Automatic Collection Settings<br/>
       Here there are two options. The first option causes collection to occur every 1 to 320 hours (30 days). The second option causes a
       collection to occur at a specified time every day (i.e. the collection occurs every 24 hours).</p>

       <p>Alarm Settings<br/>
       This is the path to the Alarm Control Program that allows the add-on to alert system administrators that something
       has happened that requires their attention. The control program is provided with this add-on, and it's use is optional but recommended.</p>
   </div>
</div>

<div class="helpTitle">Database Structure</div>
<div class="helpContent">
   <p>The database schema is intended to be simple and easy to use in other applications.  This schema is fixed and cannot be
   configured.  There is always a "metadata" table and one table per trend source that is exported from WebCTRL.</p>
   <div class="helpSubTitle">Metadata Table</div>
   <div class="helpContent">
      <p>The metadata table contains one row for every trend source that has been exported to this database.  This table consists
      of the following columns:</p>
      <table>
         <thead>
         <th>Column Name</th>
         <th>Column Type</th>
         <th>Description</th>
         </thead>
         <tbody>
         <tr><td>ID</td><td>integer</td><td>An autogenerated integer used as the primary key for this table.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>ReferencePath</td><td>string</td><td>The full reference name path to the trend source.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>DisplayName</td><td>string</td><td>The display name of the trend source.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>DisplayPath</td><td>string</td><td>The full display name path to the trend source</td></tr>
         <tr><td>TableName</td><td>string</td><td>The name of the table which has the data for this trend source.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>SourceType</td><td>short integer</td><td>1 for analog trends, 2 for digital trends, or 3 for equipment color (only in WebCTRL v5.5 and later)</td></tr>
         </tbody>
      </table>
   </div>
   <div class="helpSubTitle">Trend Data Tables</div>
   <div class="helpContent">
      <p>Each trend source's data is put into a separate table.  The source type (which can be found in the metadata table) determines the data type of the "TrendData" column.
      For analog trends, the "TrendData" column is a floating point number, for digial trends it is a boolean and for equipment color trends it is a short.  Trend data can
      also be missing, which we call "holes" in the data.  This table therefore has a "TrendType" column which will have a value of 1 when the row represents a trend data sample.
      When a hole in the data is found, two records are written to the table.  The first has a type of 2 and marks the start of the hole, and second has a type of 3 and marks
      the end of the hole.</p>
      <table>
         <thead>
         <th>Column Name</th>
         <th>Column Type</th>
         <th>Description</th>
         </thead>
         <tbody>
         <tr><td>ID</td><td>integer</td><td>An autogenerated integer used as the primary key for this table.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>DateStamp</td><td>date</td><td>The date when this sample (or hole) occurred.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>TrendData</td><td>variable*</td><td>The sample data, or null if a hole</td></tr>
         <tr><td>TrendType</td><td>short</td><td>1 for a data sample, 2 for a hole start, 3 for a hole end</td></tr>
         </tbody>
      </table>
      <br/>
      <em>* floating point for analog trends, boolean for digital trends and short for equipment color trends.  Short values for equipment colors are:
      <ul>
         <li>Mustard color (-1). Status unknown. This is used when the system is in design mode.</li>
         <li>Purple color (0). No communications because of a hardware problem.</li>
         <li>Gray color (1). Unoccupied or Inactive.</li>
